# Engineering Runtime Malware Detection - Analysis Engine

This is an analysis engine written in Python 3.X designed to take in log files provided by Prof. Jose Morales and output a malware infection tree with a designated suspicion score.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository using git onto a local directory.
Install all Python 3.X dependencies laid out in requirements.txt. Run [pip|pip3 install -r requirements.txt] to install all dependencies. It helps to set up a Python virtual environment to ensure the dependencies do not clash with system installed packages.

To run this tool, naviate to the root directory and perform the following.
1. Run [ pip install . ]. This will install the ermd_analysis package onto your local machine.
2. Configure config.yml to your needs.
```
The [ count ] field dictates how many log files are processed.
The [ log_path ] field tells the engine what directory the logs are stored in. The analysis engine will search recursively through the directory.
The [ ouput_dir ] field tells the analysis engine what directory to save the results in. Make sure this directory exists before running the engine, as the analysis engine will not create this directory automatically.
The [ log_pattern ] field tells the analysis engine what file extensions to look for when searching for log files.
```
3. Run [ python ermd_analysis/\_\_init\_\_.py config.yml ] to run the analysis engine. You should be able to see debug output on the console.
